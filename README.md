# Statistics
Statistics using Python

Case studies:
<br>
## Continuous probability distributions
- Application of exponential distribution: modeling the lifespan of a light bulb;
- Application of normal distribution: company’s sales.

Using the concepts of probability density function (PDF) and cumulative probability density function (CDF).
<br><br>
## Discrete probability distributions
<br>
- Application of Uniform Distribution: probability on a 6-sided die and arrival time of a bus at a terminal;
<br>
- Application of Binomial Distribution: probability of users opening advertising SMS and occurrences of accidents in a factory;
<br>
- Application of Poisson: study of a dataset about employee accidents in a company.
